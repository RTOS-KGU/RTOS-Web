Limited resources of battery-operated mobile devices are a major obstacles for mobile applications. Recently, cloud computing has emerged as an obvious solution to the intrinsic resource limitation of mobile devices. In this area, we do research on effective, efficient, scalable, and secure run-time infrastructure to enable seamless execution of mobile applications in the mobile cloud, thus saving valuable energy resources of mobile devices. In particular, our research focuses on energy efficient resource allocation problems in complex, hybrid cloud environment.

Software-defined networking (SDN) technology is an approach to cloud computing that facilitates network management and enables programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring. SDN is meant to address the fact that the static architecture of traditional networks is decentralized and complex while current networks require more flexibility and easy troubleshooting. SDN suggests to centralize network intelligence in one network component by disassociating the forwarding process of network packets (data plane) from the routing process (control plane). The control plane consists of one or more controllers which are considered as the brain of SDN network where the whole intelligence is incorporated. However, the intelligence centralization has its own drawbacks when it comes to security, scalability and elasticity and this is the main issue of SDN.

Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
